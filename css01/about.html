        Outside, a gentle rain began to fall, pattering softly against the
        windowpane, blurring the vibrant greens of the garden into a watercolor
        haze. A forgotten book lay open on the armchair, its pages yellowed with
        age, a silent testament to stories untold and adventures unread.

        The air, thick with the scent of brewing tea and distant woodsmoke,
        hinted at the comforting ritual of an afternoon curled up indoors. A
        sudden gust of wind rattled the loose pane, and a lone, withered leaf
        detached itself from the branch outside, spiraling down to join its kin
        on the damp earth below.
